# Data Analyst Project - Hotel Analysis

## Requirements:
1. Is the hotel revenue growing by year per hotel type?
2. Should the hotel increase their parking lot size?
3. What is the daily average rate and guests to learn more about seasonality?

Tools: Excel, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Power BI

## 1. Create a database

To import the excel file, I built a database in MS SQL Server so that I can see all the tables and write queries to extract the necessary information for my dashboard. 

## 2. Queries 

([stays_in_weekend_nights] + [stays_in_week_nights]) * ([adr] * (1 - [Discount]))

## 3. Load the Data

## 4. Final Dashboard and Analysis

The hotel revenue is growing by year in which the city hotel brings in more revenue than the resort style for the hotel. 
Based on the dashboard, the hotel should not increase their parking lot size because although the trendline is going up, it is not at a sleep slope or a rapid growth which means that expanding their parking lot should not be their main priority. 
The average daily rate is $104 and the most popular season for all 3 years is the summer because the revenue is the highest towards the 2nd half of the year due to summer vacations and holidays. 
The total revenue is $29 million between 2018 and 2020.
